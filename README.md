# NurtureNavigator


## Elevator Pitch
Your one-stop destination for all things plants! Whether you're a seasoned botanist or just getting started on your green journey, our platform is designed to enrich your plant-loving life.

## Concept
We wanted to give users the opportunity to effortlessly explore a vast database of plants from around the world. Additionally, we provide users with the ability to create their own dedicated plant haven where they can organize and manage their botanical buddies. Track watering schedules, receive timely reminders, and document your plants' growth through photos and notes. Your plants, your way, all in one convenient digital space.

## User Story
- When a User opens the Nurture Navigator application,
  - They should see a clean, serene, and polished UI, a simple navigation, and photos of plants.
- When a User creates an account,
  - They are prompted to Login.
- When a User is logged in,
  - They are brought to their personal profile page where they can add a new plant note.
- When a user searches for a plant,
  - The API brings up the plant, a photo of a plant, and the plant's name.
- When a User clicks the Logo,
  - They are brought to the landing page.

## Future User Story
- When a user comes to the landing page,
  - They can choose between Getting Started or Live Demo.
- When a user clicks on Get Started,
  - They should be taken to a Create account page.
- When a user clicks on Live Demo,
  - They are taken to the plant search page.
- When a User clicks the Logo,
  - They are brought to a page of other Users where they can follow and comment on users' profiles.
